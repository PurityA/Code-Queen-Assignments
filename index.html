       <h1>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h1>

<p>
    Breaking silence in 1960's mulitiple legacies of class and social descrimination among women being seen as bad omen was hinted on by different writters. popular mythology claims that in african clutures acrowing hen is abad tiding that has to be expiated through the immediate slaughter of the offending bird so women like Hon.mary karoro okurut, Gorret kyomuhendo and many others through their works showed that women have to have equall rights as those of men.for example kyomuhendo presents the change in perception of an African girl in her book the "first daughter" and this trigered alot of confidence in women to educate their  and empower their daughters with alot of difficulties but firght for grace.
    The breath of new air in the last years about political,education social equality called out women to chanlenge men.in uganda over the years, works of men was more valued than anyother thing but today women have a say about their lives they can drive own properties take car of homes and it has go as far as joining politics. women are more proud of presidents like samia suluh of Tanzania. the ministers of state being women who can do good if not grate than men.this gives a relife to the grand parents of the country.
